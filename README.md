## 🚀 What Makes Insyte Different?

Traditional BI tools require writing SQL, building dashboards manually, or navigating complex chart builders.  
Insyte removes all that friction with an **AI-first workflow**.

### With Insyte, you can:

- **Describe insights in plain English**  
  Examples:  
  *“Show me monthly revenue growth.”*  
  *“Compare sales by region.”*

- **Chat with your data**  
  Ask follow-up questions, refine visuals, and dive deeper into insights.

- **Get automatic AI-generated visualisations**  
  Insyte intelligently selects the best chart type and formatting for your data.

Insyte is built as a true **AI-native BI tool**, not a dashboard tool with AI bolted on.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Ask in plain English**  
   Navigate to the chat interface and type your question.

2. **AI interprets your query**  
   Insyte reads your schema, understands context, and generates accurate SQL.

3. **Query executes automatically**  
   The backend runs the SQL securely on your database.

4. **AI visualises the result**  
   The system chooses the best chart/table format for the data returned.

   Modify metrics, formatting, chart types, or drill down further — all through chat.

The entire flow gives you **question → query → insight → decision** in seconds.
